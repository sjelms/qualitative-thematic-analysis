# Working as Learning Framework (WALF) Matrix for Ethnographic Fieldwork

This matrix is designed to chart fieldwork excerpts against the two-dimensional analytical space of WALF, including vertical (macro/meso/micro) and horizontal (stages of production) dimensions, expansive–restrictive learning environments, and other metrics (discretion, trust, artefacts, learning territories).

| Fieldwork Excerpt (your notes/transcripts) | Macro / Meso / Micro | Stage (Upstream → Downstream) | Locus of Control | Expansive / Restrictive | Discretion | Trust | Artefacts | Learning Territories | Notes / Examples from WALF Literature |
|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------|------------------|-------------------------|------------|-------|-----------|----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| *“Factory floor operator shows trainee how to reset digital machine during downtime.”* | **Micro** (day-to-day practice) | **Midstream** (assembly process) | Local supervisors, but shaped by upstream design standards | **Expansive** (peer-to-peer skill sharing, boundary crossing) | Medium – operator adapts training to context | High – trusted to improvise | Digital machine; training notes | Prior apprenticeship makes operator confident | Cf. ETM instructors creating their own choreography = expansive learning [oai_citation:0‡Chapter 5 Exercising to Music.md](file-service://file-EJnbWfpqqX6y6PjTK9t5E4) |
| *“Union training officer describes pressure from national policy on apprenticeship standards.”* | **Macro** (national VET policy) | **Upstream** (training curriculum) | Macro controls shaping meso (firm-level) provision | **Restrictive** (fixed curriculum, little adaptation) | Low – little room for discretion | Medium – trust only in compliance | National standards, certification forms | Officer’s biography: ex-tradesperson, now trainer | Similar to health visitors bound by NHS protocols despite local autonomy [oai_citation:1‡Chapter 4 Promoting Health.md](file-service://file-8mdKxR8CDTj6L7Rt9EKZWb) |
| *“Quality inspector uses digital checklist to approve modules before shipping.”* | **Meso** (firm procedures) | **Downstream** (quality control before client delivery) | Downstream client requirements dominate | **Restrictive** (checklist reduces scope for learning) | Low – tick-box procedure | Low – system enforces compliance | Digital QC checklist | Prior skills irrelevant; role flattened | Mirrors call centre scripts restricting operator discretion [oai_citation:2‡Chapter 3 Processing Calls.md](file-service://file-R5fDwje4oukdW4RbTRdu7b) |

## Key WALF Dimensions and How to Use Them

### Vertical Axis – **Structures of Production**
- **Macro**: National/international regulations, economic and policy pressures (e.g. EU directives on universities shaping researcher contracts [oai_citation:5‡Chapter 6 Creating Knowledge.md](file-service://file-QJK5ZA4ZvQGH4VWQf9AR2V)).  
- **Meso**: Sector bodies, company structures, unions, accreditation schemes (e.g. supermarkets dictating standards to sandwich makers [oai_citation:6‡Chapter 7 Making Sandwiches.md](file-service://file-G1befAFYjt5eTw7eey6Zeq)).  
- **Micro**: Local workplace practices (e.g. call centre scripts shaping operators’ daily learning [oai_citation:7‡Chapter 3 Processing Calls.md](file-service://file-R5fDwje4oukdW4RbTRdu7b)).

### Horizontal Axis – **Stages of Production**
- **Upstream**: Design, planning, early stages.  
- **Midstream**: Manufacturing, assembly, coordination.  
- **Downstream**: Quality control, delivery, client interface.  
- **Insight**: WALF shows locus of control can sit upstream (e.g. branded fitness class designers [oai_citation:8‡Chapter 5 Exercising to Music.md](file-service://file-EJnbWfpqqX6y6PjTK9t5E4)) or downstream (e.g. supermarkets over sandwich makers [oai_citation:9‡Chapter 7 Making Sandwiches.md](file-service://file-G1befAFYjt5eTw7eey6Zeq)).

### Expansive–Restrictive Learning Environments
- **Expansive**: Cross-boundary, innovative, developmental, high discretion.  
- **Restrictive**: Siloed, compliance-focused, low discretion.  
- Examples:  
  - *Expansive*: Health visitors forming a “community of practice” to reshape their role [oai_citation:10‡Chapter 4 Promoting Health.md](file-service://file-8mdKxR8CDTj6L7Rt9EKZWb).  
  - *Restrictive*: Supermarket staff forced to follow planograms and symbol guns with little room for discretion [oai_citation:11‡Chapter 8 Utilizing Artefacts.md](file-service://file-L1joxeUTUrTaEDkwDJYTdd).  

### Additional Metrics
- **Discretion**: Level of autonomy in task execution.  
- **Trust**: Whether workers are trusted to innovate.  
- **Artefacts**: Tools, technologies, forms mediating learning (e.g. CAD drawings, checklists, NVQ standards).  
- **Learning Territories**: Worker biographies shaping how they engage (e.g. ETM instructors relishing freestyle vs. fearing it [oai_citation:12‡Chapter 5 Exercising to Music.md](file-service://file-EJnbWfpqqX6y6PjTK9t5E4)).  
- **Breakdowns**: System malfunctions revealing hidden learning (e.g. call centres absorbing specialist roles [oai_citation:13‡Chapter 3 Processing Calls.md](file-service://file-R5fDwje4oukdW4RbTRdu7b)).

# Source-of-Truth Guide: Working as Learning Framework (WALF)

This guide combines **light-touch chapter summaries** (to provide narrative grounding) with **element-based exemplars** (to show how each WALF category works across cases). The aim is to create modular, compartmentalized examples that demonstrate how WALF can be applied to real-world ethnographic data.

---

## Part I. Chapter Summaries (Context)

### Chapter 1: Setting the Scene
This opening chapter introduces WALF as a new analytical framework for understanding workplace learning. The authors argue that learning at work is shaped not only by individual tasks or training events but also by wider organisational and systemic contexts. They emphasise the need for a holistic model that incorporates both vertical (macro/meso/micro structures) and horizontal (stages of production) dimensions.

### Chapter 2: Mapping the Working as Learning Framework
Here, WALF is formally articulated. It integrates three traditions:  
1. Economic theory → “productive systems.”  
2. Sociology of work → discretion and trust.  
3. Workplace learning → expansive–restrictive continuum.  
The chapter maps vertical structures of production (macro/meso/micro) and horizontal stages (upstream → downstream), showing how the locus of control can shift in either axis.

### Chapter 3: Processing Calls
Case study of a local authority contact centre. The creation of “County Talk” consolidated multiple departmental front offices into one centralised unit. This shifted power within the productive system, reducing discretion for many specialists while creating new routines for operators. Revealed both restrictive scripts and opportunities for emotional labour/advocacy.

### Chapter 4: Promoting Health
Two-year initiative by a group of health visitors in Mid City, England. Calling themselves a “community of practice,” they sought to innovate and improve professional practice. Initially expansive (self-directed, reflective, collaborative), their efforts were curtailed by vertical managerial pressures from Primary Care Trusts and doctors, turning their environment increasingly restrictive.

### Chapter 5: Exercising to Music
Case study of fitness instructors delivering group classes. Compared “freestyle” (instructors design their own choreography) versus “pre-choreographed” systems (corporate-designed routines). Freestyle offered expansive environments (innovation, discretion, cross-boundary learning), while pre-choreographed classes were restrictive (compliance, standardisation).

### Chapter 6: Creating Knowledge
Study of contract researchers at a Russell Group university and software engineers at a private company. Both were “knowledge workers,” but the structures of production differed. Universities had macro-level controls (government, EU legislation) that constrained discretion. The software company offered more local discretion but was shaped by global market pressures.

### Chapter 7: Making Sandwiches
Study of sandwich production for supermarkets versus manufacturer-branded lines. Retailer label (supermarket-branded) sandwiches were restrictive, with supermarkets dictating terms. Manufacturer label sandwiches offered more scope for innovation and discretion. Highlights how downstream actors (supermarkets) can control upstream processes.

### Chapter 8: Utilizing Artefacts
Focus on how workplace artefacts (tools, technologies, documents) mediate learning. Case studies in automotive manufacturing and supermarket retailing showed artefacts could act as boundary objects, enabling expansive learning, or as instruments of control, restricting discretion. Artefacts embody both enabling and constraining forces.

### Chapter 9: Bringing Working and Learning Together
The concluding chapter synthesises findings. WALF demonstrates that workplace learning cannot be understood in isolation but is shaped by broader productive systems, organisational structures, and worker biographies. Learning environments are dynamic, shifting between expansive and restrictive depending on context, artefacts, and locus of control.

## Part II. Element-Based Exemplars

### 1. Vertical Axis – Macro / Meso / Micro

**Macro Examples:**
- **EU directives on fixed-term contracts** forced UK universities to restructure researcher employment, constraining autonomy (Chapter 6).  
- **National health policy (“Sure Start”)** reshaped health visiting services, influencing what counted as legitimate work (Chapter 4).  
- **Supermarket chains** imposed strict hygiene and production standards, dictating conditions for suppliers (Chapter 7).

**Meso Examples:**
- **Primary Care Trusts (PCTs)** set managerial priorities and reporting requirements that clashed with health visitors’ innovation (Chapter 4).  
- **Club management** in fitness centres scheduled classes, influencing instructors’ discretion and trust (Chapter 5).  
- **Local authority managers** centralised service delivery in contact centres, reconfiguring departmental autonomy (Chapter 3).

**Micro Examples:**
- **Call centre operators** followed scripts but also engaged in unofficial problem-solving and advocacy (Chapter 3).  
- **Individual ETM instructors** crafted their own choreography in freestyle classes, drawing on biographies and creativity (Chapter 5).  
- **Health visitors** negotiated entry into family homes, exercising professional judgement in situ (Chapter 4).

---

### 2. Horizontal Axis – Stages of Production

**Upstream Examples:**
- **Design engineers** (offsite construction parallel) influence how downstream fitters must work; in WALF, fitness class designers in pre-choreography had upstream control (Chapter 5).  
- **Supermarket buyers** dictated sandwich recipes and ingredients upstream (Chapter 7).  
- **University researchers** dependent on upstream grant funding to even begin projects (Chapter 6).

**Midstream Examples:**
- **Assembly-line sandwich makers** followed prescribed recipes, often under Taylorised conditions (Chapter 7).  
- **Health visitors** in midstream delivery of care sought to innovate but were squeezed by upstream policy and downstream reporting (Chapter 4).  
- **Call centre operators** as midstream actors interfaced between public callers and back-office specialists (Chapter 3).

**Downstream Examples:**
- **Clients/customers** exerting power: supermarket consumers’ preferences shaped production (Chapter 7).  
- **End-users of healthcare** (families) influenced health visitors’ day-to-day discretion (Chapter 4).  
- **Corporate clients** demanded software engineers deliver on time, shaping how knowledge work was organised (Chapter 6).

---

### 3. Expansive–Restrictive Learning Environments

**Expansive Examples:**
- Health visitors’ “community of practice” innovating care approaches, drawing on shared training and cross-professional ties (Chapter 4).  
- Freestyle ETM instructors designing routines, building boundary-crossing skills (Chapter 5).  
- Manufacturer-label sandwich firms retaining some autonomy to innovate and differentiate products (Chapter 7).

**Restrictive Examples:**
- Contact centre operators constrained by scripts and call guides, limiting critical reflexivity (Chapter 3).  
- Pre-choreographed ETM instructors reduced to “recipe followers,” compliance-focused roles (Chapter 5).  
- University researchers constrained by short-term contracts and compliance with macro-level legislation (Chapter 6).

---

### 4. Additional Metrics

**Discretion:**
- High: Health visitors exercising professional judgement in family homes (Chapter 4).  
- Low: Sandwich factory workers confined to repetitive tasks (Chapter 7).

**Trust:**
- High: Freestyle instructors trusted to design safe and engaging classes (Chapter 5).  
- Low: Supermarkets requiring intensive inspections of suppliers (Chapter 7).

**Artefacts:**
- Enabling: CAD drawings as boundary objects between engineers and fitters (parallel from construction; Chapter 8 examples show manuals or devices shared across teams).  
- Restrictive: Symbol guns in supermarkets enforcing centralised stock control (Chapter 8).  

**Learning Territories (Worker Biographies):**
- Experienced ETM instructors relished freestyle innovation; inexperienced ones preferred pre-choreography (Chapter 5).  
- Newly qualified health visitors felt isolated, while experienced ones leveraged broad training for autonomy (Chapter 4).  
- Software engineers’ personal identities shaped their integration into company culture (Chapter 6).
