# Implementation Plan: Computer-Assisted Qualitative Data Analysis System

**Branch**: `001-computer-assisted-qualitative` | **Date**: 2025-09-17 | **Spec**: [link](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-computer-assisted-qualitative/spec.md`

## Summary
This plan outlines the implementation of a computer-assisted qualitative data analysis system. The system will assist a single researcher in performing Reflexive Thematic Analysis (TA) guided by the Working as Learning Framework (WALF). The technical approach is a Python-based CLI application that interacts with an LLM API.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11
**Primary Dependencies**: `openai`, `python-docx`, `PyPDF2`, `markdown`
**Storage**: Filesystem (Markdown and JSON files)
**Testing**: `pytest`
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform (macOS, Linux, Windows)
**Project Type**: Single project
**Performance Goals**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Initial focus is on functionality, not performance.]
**Constraints**: Neurodiversity-informed design, secure API key storage.
**Scale/Scope**: Single researcher application.

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

No constitution defined. The constitution file is a template.

**Structure Decision**: Option 1: Single project

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
Research has been conducted to address the open questions from the feature specification. The findings are consolidated in `research.md`.

**Output**: `research.md` with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
The design phase is complete. The data model, CLI contracts, and a quickstart guide have been created.

**Output**: `data-model.md`, `contracts/cli-contracts.md`, `quickstart.md`.

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base.
- Generate tasks from the design documents (`data-model.md`, `contracts/cli-contracts.md`, `quickstart.md`).
- Each CLI command in `cli-contracts.md` will have a corresponding task for implementation and testing.
- Each entity in `data-model.md` will have a task for creating the corresponding Python class.
- A task will be created to implement the interactive review session.

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation.
- Dependency order: Models before services before CLI.

**Estimated Output**: 10-15 numbered, ordered tasks in `tasks.md`.

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [X] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [X] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [X] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
