### Work Log: 2025-09-17 (Session 1)

#### What's Been Done Today:

1.  **Feature Scaffolding:**
    *   Created the `001-computer-assisted-qualitative` feature branch.
    *   Generated the initial feature specification in `specs/001-computer-assisted-qualitative/spec.md`.

2.  **Planning and Design:**
    *   Generated a detailed implementation plan (`plan.md`).
    *   Created associated design artifacts: `research.md`, `data-model.md`, `contracts/cli-contracts.md`, and `quickstart.md`.

3.  **Project Governance:**
    *   Updated the project constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) to reflect the project's technical and workflow decisions.
    *   Synchronized the templates (`plan-template.md`, `spec-template.md`, `tasks-template.md`) with the new constitution.

4.  **Task Generation:**
    *   Generated a detailed, dependency-ordered list of implementation tasks in `specs/001-computer-assisted-qualitative/tasks.md`.

5.  **Context and Review:**
    *   Created the `GEMINI.md` file to provide me with long-term context about the project.
    *   Reviewed the `source-of-truth-guide.md` and confirmed its robustness.

#### Where to Pick Up Tomorrow:

*   The next step is to begin executing the implementation tasks defined in `tasks.md`.
*   We should start with **Phase 3.1: Setup**, beginning with task **T001**: "Create project structure with `src` and `tests` directories."
