# Integrating Braun & Clarke’s Thematic Analysis with the Working as Learning Framework (WALF)

## Introduction

This document provides a structured integration of Braun & Clarke’s (2001) Thematic Analysis (TA) with the Working as Learning Framework (WALF) (Felstead et al. 2009). Its purpose is to link the phases of qualitative analysis with the dimensions of WALF and the system workflow used in qualitative data analysis. This integration supports a coherent approach for managing, interpreting, and reporting qualitative data within a learning-oriented framework, ensuring analytic rigor and alignment with conceptual models.

## Framework Positioning

- **Reflexive Thematic Analysis (Braun and Clarke 2021)** is the primary qualitative analytic method employed, emphasizing researcher reflexivity, iterative coding, and theme development.
- **Working as Learning Framework (WALF) (Felstead et al. 2009)** provides a conceptual lens to interpret data across macro, meso, and micro levels, and along expansive–restrictive dimensions, enriching the analytic depth.
- **Grounded Theory** is referenced in source materials but serves only as background context and is not a primary analytic method in this integration.

## 1. Familiarisation with the Data

**Analytic Focus:**  
Immersing oneself in the data to gain a deep understanding, reading transcripts and materials multiple times, noting initial impressions and ideas.

**WALF Alignment:**  
Interpret data across WALF’s macro (organizational), meso (team), and micro (individual) levels, noting expansive or restrictive learning conditions evident in the data.

**System Role:**  
LLM aids by generating summaries, highlighting salient points, and extracting initial observations; human oversight ensures contextual accuracy and reflexive engagement.

**Outputs:**  
Initial notes, memos, and YAML front matter documenting data characteristics and preliminary reflections.

## 2. Generating Initial Codes

**Analytic Focus:**  
Systematic coding of interesting features of the data relevant to the research questions, capturing semantic and latent content.

**WALF Alignment:**  
Codes are tagged or categorized to reflect WALF dimensions, distinguishing between expansive and restrictive learning conditions at different systemic levels.

**System Role:**  
LLM proposes initial codes based on text segments; human analysts review, refine, and validate codes to maintain analytic integrity.

**Outputs:**  
Code lists, annotated transcripts, and JSON exports of coded segments.

## 3. Constructing Themes

**Analytic Focus:**  
Collating codes into potential themes, identifying patterns of meaning and relationships among codes.

**WALF Alignment:**  
Themes are constructed to reflect WALF’s conceptual dimensions, highlighting how learning processes manifest across system levels and conditions.

**System Role:**  
LLM assists by clustering related codes and suggesting theme labels; human analysts interpret and shape themes with reflexive insight.

**Outputs:**  
Preliminary theme maps, thematic summaries, and updated memos.

## 4. Reviewing Themes

**Analytic Focus:**  
Checking themes against coded data and entire data set for coherence, consistency, and meaningfulness.

**WALF Alignment:**  
Themes are evaluated for alignment with WALF’s expansive–restrictive continuum and multi-level framework, ensuring conceptual fit.

**System Role:**  
LLM supports by cross-referencing themes with data excerpts; human reviewers critically assess theme validity and revise as needed.

**Outputs:**  
Revised theme structures, validation notes, and audit trail documentation.

---

## 5. Defining and Naming Themes

**Analytic Focus:**  
Refining specifics of each theme, defining scope and focus, and generating concise, evocative names.

**WALF Alignment:**  
Theme definitions explicitly incorporate WALF dimensions, articulating how themes reflect learning conditions and systemic interactions.

**System Role:**  
LLM suggests theme definitions and names based on analytic content; human analysts finalize wording to ensure clarity and conceptual precision.

**Outputs:**  
Finalized theme definitions, named themes, and descriptive memos.

---

## 6. Writing the Report

**Analytic Focus:**  
Producing the final analytic narrative, integrating themes with data extracts and theoretical interpretation.

**WALF Alignment:**  
The report situates findings within WALF, discussing implications across macro, meso, and micro levels and expansive–restrictive learning dynamics.

**System Role:**  
LLM drafts narrative sections and integrates coded data; human authors edit, contextualize, and ensure reflexive transparency.

**Outputs:**  
Complete analytic report, including YAML front matter, thematic summaries, and exportable JSON datasets.

## Quality and Reflexivity

Ongoing reflexivity is maintained throughout all phases, with researchers critically examining their assumptions and decisions in relation to the data and WALF framework. Constitution principles guide ethical and transparent analytic practice. An audit trail is maintained documenting analytic choices, system interactions, and reflexive memos to enhance trustworthiness and reproducibility.

## Use in Spec & Plan

This methods-to-system map directly informs specification and planning documents, serving as the analytic backbone for qualitative data projects. It ensures alignment between analytic phases, conceptual frameworks, and system workflows, supporting coherent and rigorous qualitative analysis.
