### Work Log: 2025-09-19 (Session 1)

#### What's Been Done Today:

1.  **Housekeeping:**
    *   Upgraded brew packages.
    *   Reviewed the previous worklog to set the context for today's session.

2.  **WALF Framework Enhancement:**
    *   Reviewed the new `working-as-learning-framework-matrix.md` to understand its detailed guidance.
    *   Updated the `source-of-truth-guide.md` to reference the new matrix, ensuring the two documents are linked.

3.  **Project Setup (Phase 3.1):**
    *   **T001**: Created the `src` and `tests` directories.
    *   **T002**: Initialized the Python project by creating a `requirements.txt` file, setting up a `.venv` virtual environment, and installing the necessary dependencies.
    *   Added the `.venv` directory to `.gitignore` to keep the repository clean.
    *   **T003**: Configured `black` and `ruff` for code formatting and linting via a new `pyproject.toml` file.

4.  **Test-First Development (Phase 3.2):**
    *   Wrote and confirmed failing contract tests for all CLI commands as per the Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology:
        *   **T004**: `qta ingest`
        *   **T005**: `qta analyze`
        *   **T006**: `qta review`
        *   **T007**: `qta report`
    *   **T008**: Wrote and confirmed a failing integration test for the main user workflow, covering the sequence from ingestion to reporting.

5.  **Task Management:**
    *   Updated `tasks.md` to mark all tasks from Phase 3.1 and 3.2 (T001-T008) as complete.

#### Where to Pick Up Next Session:

*   The next step is to begin **Phase 3.3: Core Implementation**.
*   We will start with task **T009**: "Implement data models in `src/models.py`."
