# Feature Specification: Computer-Assisted Qualitative Data Analysis System

**Feature Branch**: `001-computer-assisted-qualitative`  
**Created**: 2025-09-17  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Computer-Assisted Qualitative Data Analysis System"

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a doctoral researcher in vocational education, I need a system that helps me analyze qualitative data using Reflexive Thematic Analysis (TA) and the Working as Learning Framework (WALF). The system should act as a "more knowledgeable other," assisting me in coding and theme development, while I maintain full interpretive control.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have a set of interview transcripts in `.txt` and `.md` format, **When** I ingest them into the system, **Then** the system should accept and process the files.
2. **Given** that data has been ingested, **When** I start the analysis process, **Then** the system, guided by WALF and TA principles, should propose initial codes and themes from the data.
3. **Given** the system has proposed codes and themes, **When** I review them, **Then** I should be able to accept, reject, or modify the suggestions and add my own.
4. **Given** I have a finalized set of themes, **When** I generate a report, **Then** the system should produce a Markdown file with YAML front matter, and a JSON file containing the structured data.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a non-text file (e.g., an image) is provided for ingestion? The system should reject the file and notify the user.
- How does the system handle very large text files? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the maximum file size? Are there performance considerations?]
- What happens if the LLM API is unavailable? The system should notify the user and allow for local, manual coding.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow ingestion of textual data in `.txt`, `.md`, `.docx`, and `.pdf` formats.
- **FR-002**: System MUST NOT support audio or video file ingestion.
- **FR-003**: System MUST use an LLM to propose candidate codes and themes based on the ingested data.
- **FR-004**: The proposed codes and themes MUST be aligned with the Working as Learning Framework (WALF) and Reflexive Thematic Analysis (TA).
- **FR-005**: The researcher MUST have the ability to review, approve, modify, or delete any AI-generated suggestions.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST support iterative rounds of coding and theme refinement.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST version control codebooks, schemas, and analytic memos.
- **FR-008**: System MUST generate Markdown reports with YAML front matter.
- **FR-009**: System MUST generate JSON exports of segments, codes, themes, and memos.
- **FR-010**: All outputs MUST maintain traceability links between data, codes, themes, and research questions.
- **FR-011**: The system MUST be designed for a single researcher; no multi-user collaboration is required in the initial version.
- **FR-012**: The system's design MUST incorporate principles of neurodiversity-informed design to reduce cognitive load.
- **FR-013**: The LLM API key MUST be stored securely and not be part of the public repository.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Raw Data**: The ingested textual data (transcripts, notes, etc.).
- **Code**: A label assigned to a segment of text.
- **Theme**: A higher-level pattern of meaning, derived from codes.
- **Codebook**: A document that defines the codes and their usage.
- **Analytic Memo**: A researcher's reflective notes on the analysis.
- **Report**: The final output of the analysis, in Markdown and JSON formats.
