### Work Log: 2025-09-20 (Session 1)

#### What's Been Done Today:

1.  **Major Architectural Pivot:**
    *   Discussed and approved a significant pivot from a Python CLI application to a more interactive and robust **Jupyter Notebook-based workflow running inside a Docker container**.
    *   The new approach leverages the Jupyter Scientific Python Stack (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, etc.) to avoid reinventing data analysis tools and to provide a better user experience for the researcher.

2.  **Version Control & Housekeeping:**
    *   A new branch, `feature/002-jupyter-pivot`, was created to provide a clean slate for the new architecture.
    *   Obsolete artifacts from the previous CLI-based approach were deleted, including old contract tests (`tests/contract/`), `pyproject.toml`, and `requirements.txt`.

3.  **Documentation and Planning Overhaul:**
    *   Updated the project constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) to reflect the new technology stack (Python 3.13, Docker, Jupyter) and the shift from a CLI to a notebook-based interface.
    *   Rewrote the implementation plan (`specs/001-computer-assisted-qualitative/plan.md`) to detail the new architecture.
    *   Replaced the old task list with a new one in `specs/001-computer-assisted-qualitative/tasks.md` that outlines the steps for setting up the new environment and developing the notebook.

4.  **New Environment Scaffolding:**
    *   Created a `Dockerfile` to define the Jupyter environment with all necessary scientific libraries.
    *   Created a `docker-compose.yml` file to simplify container management.
    *   Added a `.dockerignore` file to ensure a lean container image.
    *   Established the new project directory structure (`notebooks/`, `data/`, `src/`).

5.  **Initial Notebook Setup:**
    *   Created the initial analysis notebook at `notebooks/analysis.ipynb`.
    *   Structured the notebook with markdown sections for Introduction, Setup, Data Ingestion, Analysis, and Reporting.
    *   Added the initial code cell for importing necessary libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, etc.).

6.  **Environment Launch:**
    *   Built and launched the Docker container using `docker-compose up --build`.
    *   Successfully accessed the JupyterLab interface and set a password.

#### Where to Pick Up Next:

*   The environment is fully configured and running.
*   The next step is to begin **Phase 3: Core Workflow Implementation**, starting with task **T008**: "Implement data ingestion logic in the notebook to read files from `data/raw`."
