# Implementation Plan: Computer-Assisted Qualitative Data Analysis System

**Branch**: `feature/002-jupyter-pivot` | **Date**: 2025-09-20 | **Spec**: [link](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-computer-assisted-qualitative/spec.md`

## Summary
This plan outlines the implementation of a computer-assisted qualitative data analysis system. The system will assist a single researcher in performing Reflexive Thematic Analysis (TA) guided by the Working as Learning Framework (WALF). The technical approach is a **Jupyter Notebook-based workflow running within a Docker container**, leveraging the Jupyter Scientific Python Stack.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.13
**Core Technologies**: Docker, JupyterLab
**Primary Dependencies**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `nltk`, `spacy`, `scikit-learn`, `openai`
**Storage**: Filesystem (mapped between host and container)
**Testing**: `pytest` (for utility functions)
**Target Platform**: Any system capable of running Docker.

```

## Phase 3: Task Planning Approach (New)
The task plan will be updated to reflect the new architecture. Key tasks will include:
1.  Creating the Docker environment (`Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`).
2.  Scaffolding the new directory structure (`notebooks`, `data`).
3.  Developing the core analysis workflow within the `analysis.ipynb` notebook.
4.  Creating helper functions in `src` as needed.
